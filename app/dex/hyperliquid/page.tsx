        <section id="what-is-hyperliquid">
          <h2>What is Hyperliquid?</h2>
          <p>
            Hyperliquid is the first fully on-chain perpetual futures DEX built on its own Layer 1 blockchain. 
            Launched in 2023, it pioneered the concept of decentralized perpetuals with centralized exchange-level 
            performance by creating a custom blockchain optimized specifically for order book trading.
          </p>
          <p>
            The platform's killer feature is <strong>zero gas fees</strong> for all trading operations—placing orders, 
            canceling orders, and executing trades cost nothing. Combined with sub-100 millisecond finality and 
            $9 billion in daily volume, Hyperliquid set the gold standard for perpetual DEXs before AsterDEX launched 
            in 2025.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="key-features">
          <h2>Key Features</h2>

          <h3>1. Zero Gas Fees (Unique Advantage)</h3>
          <p>
            Hyperliquid L1 blockchain subsidizes all gas fees for trading operations. This means:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Place orders:</strong> $0 gas fee</li>
            <li><strong>Cancel orders:</strong> $0 gas fee</li>
            <li><strong>Execute trades:</strong> $0 gas fee</li>
            <li><strong>Modify positions:</strong> $0 gas fee</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Only deposits and withdrawals have minimal bridging fees ($1-5). This makes Hyperliquid ideal for 
            high-frequency traders, market makers, and anyone who makes many trades per day. No other major 
            perpetual DEX offers true zero gas fees.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Custom Layer 1 Blockchain</h3>
          <p>
            Hyperliquid L1 is purpose-built for perpetual futures trading with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sub-100ms block finality</strong> - Faster than any general-purpose chain</li>
            <li><strong>Native order book</strong> - No AMM inefficiencies or slippage</li>
            <li><strong>High throughput</strong> - Handles thousands of orders per second</li>
            <li><strong>Gas subsidization</strong> - Built-in mechanism for zero trading fees</li>
            <li><strong>Optimized consensus</strong> - Designed specifically for low-latency trading</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. Professional Trading Experience</h3>
          <p>
            Hyperliquid provides a native order book (not AMM-based) with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Real-time order book depth</li>
            <li>Limit, market, and stop orders</li>
            <li>Advanced charting with TradingView</li>
            <li>Portfolio margin system</li>
            <li>Risk management tools</li>
            <li>API access for algorithmic trading</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The trading experience matches or exceeds centralized exchanges while maintaining full decentralization—
            you always control your private keys.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Proven Track Record</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Launched: 2023</strong> - Over 2 years of continuous operation
          </p>
          <p>
            Hyperliquid has:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Never been hacked</strong> - Zero security breaches since launch</li>
            <li><strong>Audited by multiple firms</strong> - Smart contracts independently verified</li>
            <li><strong>Processed billions</strong> - Cumulative $1 trillion+ in volume</li>
            <li><strong>Established reputation</strong> - Trusted by professional traders</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This proven track record significantly reduces risk compared to platforms launched in 2025 like 
            AsterDEX (only 2 months operational).

          <h2>How to Get Started on Hyperliquid</h2>

          <h3>Step 1: Get USDC on Arbitrum</h3>
          <p>
            The fastest and cheapest way to deposit is via Arbitrum:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Buy USDC on a centralized exchange (Binance, Coinbase, etc.)</li>
            <li>Withdraw to Arbitrum network</li>
            <li>Or use a DEX to swap for USDC on Arbitrum</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Alternative:</strong> You can also bridge from Ethereum mainnet, but it costs more ($5-20 vs $1-3).
          </p>

          <h3>Step 2: Bridge to Hyperliquid L1</h3>
          <p>
            Visit <a href="/go/hyperliquid" target="_blank">hyperliquid.xyz</a> and use the official bridge:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Connect your wallet (MetaMask recommended)</li>
            <li>Select "Bridge" from Arbitrum to Hyperliquid</li>
            <li>Enter USDC amount to bridge</li>
            <li>Confirm transaction (~5 minutes)</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Step 3: Start Trading</h3>

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

          <h3>What is Hyperliquid?</h3>
          <p>
            Hyperliquid is the first fully on-chain perpetual futures DEX built on its own Layer 1 blockchain. 
            It offers zero gas fees for trading, sub-100ms execution, and processes $9B+ in daily volume. Launched 
            in 2023, it has the longest proven track record among major perpetual DEXs with zero security breaches.
          </p>

          <h3>Why does Hyperliquid have zero gas fees?</h3>
          <p>
            Hyperliquid L1 blockchain subsidizes all gas fees for trading operations. This is possible because:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>The blockchain is custom-built specifically for perpetual futures trading</li>
            <li>Not a general-purpose chain with expensive smart contract execution</li>
            <li>Optimized consensus mechanism reduces computational costs</li>
            <li>Network designed to prioritize trader experience over validator revenue</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Only deposits and withdrawals (bridging operations) have minimal fees ($1-5) because these involve 
            cross-chain communication.
          </p>

          <h3>What is the maximum leverage on Hyperliquid?</h3>
          <p>
            Hyperliquid offers up to 50x leverage on perpetual futures contracts. While lower than AsterDEX's 
            1001x or Hibachi's 100x, 50x provides:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Substantial capital efficiency for most strategies</li>
            <li>Lower liquidation risk (2% price move vs 0.1% at 1001x)</li>
            <li>More sustainable for long-term trading</li>
            <li>Professional risk management approach</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Most experienced traders agree that 50x is the optimal maximum leverage—high enough for capital 
            efficiency, low enough to avoid instant liquidation.
          </p>

          <h3>What are Hyperliquid trading fees?</h3>
          <p>
            Hyperliquid charges:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Maker fee:</strong> 0.02% (when you add liquidity with limit orders)</li>
            <li><strong>Taker fee:</strong> 0.05% (when you take liquidity with market orders)</li>
            <li><strong>Gas fees:</strong> $0 for all trading operations</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Combined with zero gas fees, this makes Hyperliquid one of the most cost-effective platforms for 
            high-frequency trading and market making. Even with 100 trades per day, you pay zero in gas.
          </p>

          <h3>What is Hyperliquid daily trading volume?</h3>
          <p>
            Hyperliquid processes over $9 billion in daily trading volume as of November 2025. This makes it:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Second-largest perpetual DEX (after AsterDEX's $32B)</li>
            <li>18x larger than Hibachi ($500M)</li>
            <li>45x larger than Lighter ($200M)</li>
            <li>Larger than many centralized exchanges</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Is Hyperliquid better than AsterDEX?</h3>
          <p>
            Hyperliquid and AsterDEX serve different trader needs:
          </p>
          <p>

            <li>Stock perpetuals trading</li>
            <li>Higher overall volume ($32B)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Does Hyperliquid require KYC?</h3>
          <p>
            No, Hyperliquid is fully decentralized and does not require KYC verification. To start trading:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Connect your wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)</li>
            <li>Bridge funds to Hyperliquid L1</li>
            <li>Start trading immediately</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            This provides complete privacy and instant access without verification delays or sharing personal data.
          </p>

          <h3>How fast are Hyperliquid transactions?</h3>
          <p>
            Hyperliquid transactions execute with <strong>sub-100 millisecond finality</strong>. This means:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Orders execute in under 0.1 seconds</li>
            <li>Faster than any multi-chain DEX</li>
            <li>Comparable to Binance and other top centralized exchanges</li>
            <li>Enables scalping and high-frequency trading strategies</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This speed is possible because Hyperliquid L1 is custom-built specifically for perpetual futures, 
            not a general-purpose blockchain.
          </p>

          <h3>What wallets work with Hyperliquid?</h3>
          <p>
            Hyperliquid supports all Ethereum-compatible wallets:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Software Wallets:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>MetaMask (most popular)</li>
            <li>Coinbase Wallet</li>
            <li>Trust Wallet</li>
            <li>Rainbow Wallet</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Hardware Wallets:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ledger (Nano S, Nano X)</li>
            <li>Trezor</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Universal:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Any WalletConnect-compatible wallet</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Is Hyperliquid safe and audited?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. Hyperliquid has:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Operated since 2023</strong> with zero security breaches or hacks</li>
            <li><strong>Multiple security audits</strong> by independent firms</li>
            <li><strong>Processed $1 trillion+</strong> in cumulative volume safely</li>
            <li><strong>Open-source smart contracts</strong> for community verification</li>
            <li><strong>Bug bounty program</strong> for responsible disclosure</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The 2+ year track record significantly reduces risk compared to new platforms launched in 2025. 
            However, all DeFi carries smart contract risk—never invest more than you can afford to lose.
          </p>

          <h3>What is Hyperliquid L1 blockchain?</h3>
          <p>
            Hyperliquid L1 is a custom Layer 1 blockchain designed exclusively for perpetual futures trading:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sub-100ms finality</strong> - Faster than Ethereum, Solana, or any general-purpose chain</li>
            <li><strong>Native order book</strong> - Built into the blockchain itself</li>
            <li><strong>Gas subsidization</strong> - Network pays for trading gas fees</li>
            <li><strong>High throughput</strong> - Thousands of orders per second</li>
            <li><strong>Optimized consensus</strong> - Designed for low-latency trading</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This specialization allows features impossible on general-purpose chains like zero gas fees and 
            sub-100ms execution.
          </p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Hyperliquid remains the gold standard for decentralized perpetual futures trading, offering the unique 
            combination of zero gas fees, sub-100ms execution, and a proven 2+ year track record with zero security 
            breaches. While AsterDEX has recently launched with higher leverage (1001x) and higher volume ($32B), 
            Hyperliquid's maturity, reliability, and truly zero-cost trading make it the safer and smarter choice 
            for professional traders.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Best for:</strong> Professional and high-frequency traders who prioritize speed, reliability, 
            zero gas fees, and proven security over extreme leverage. Ideal for market makers, scalpers, and anyone 
            making multiple trades daily.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Not recommended for:</strong> Traders who need extreme leverage beyond 50x, multi-chain trading 
            without bridging, or want to trade tokenized stocks (available on AsterDEX).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Final verdict:</strong> Hyperliquid is the most reliable and cost-effective perpetual DEX available. 
            The zero gas fees alone save serious traders thousands of dollars annually, and the 2+ year track record 
            provides peace of mind that new platforms cannot match.
